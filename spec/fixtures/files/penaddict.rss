<p>Liberty London William Morris designs get me every time and this design is completely gorgeous. Pebble Stationery has several other Liberty London designs as well, but they are fairly limited, so if you're as stricken as I was, act quickly!</p>

<p>This notebook is an A5 hardcover wrapped in fabric. It is entirely handmade, so each one is slightly unique. The binding is sewn stitch and it includes a satin ribbon bookmark that coordinates with the fabric color. The binding does allow the notebook to lie open flat, with some training. Between those stunning covers are 160 pages of blank, 75 gsm Cosmo Air Light paper. Which I now know I like very much.</p>

<p>I have been told I would love CAL paper, but I've also been told I would hate it, so I really wasn't sure what to expect. It definitely has a unique texture to it, somehow both smooth and grippy at the same time, which makes no sense unless you've used it. It's smooth, but has drag. I found it pleasant to write on. I saw beautiful shading, lovely sheening, and no feathering or bleeding. Even the Sharpie did not bleed through, which shocked me. So I got a bigger Sharpie and tried that, and it still did not bleed through. The only bleeding I got at all was when I poured ink onto the page and let it dry. Impressive.</p>

<p>The only negative issue I had with the paper at all was that it has a very long dry time, similar to most coated papers. It's not an issue that bothers me much, but I know it can be a problem for some, especially lefties.</p><p>Overall, I think this is a very nice notebook. It's well constructed with that special handmade feel, with top-notch materials. And somehow, even with all that considered, <a href="https://www.pebblestationeryco.com/collections/artisan-notebooks">it's only $28</a>. I was genuinely shocked by that price, but in a good way. It could easily have been half again as much and still reasonable, especially for a limited run. You should probably get one or three before they read this and come to their senses.</p><p>(<em><a href="https://www.pebblestationeryco.com/">Pebble Stationery</a> provided this product at no charge to The Pen Addict for review purposes.</em>)</p><hr /><p><em>Enjoy reading The Pen Addict?

<p>(<em>Jeff Abbott is a regular contributor at The Pen Addict. You can find more from Jeff online at <a href="http://draftevolution.com/">Draft Evolution</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/abbottj">Twitter</a>.</em>)</p><p>A few weeks ago, I reviewed my first ink from the <a href="https://www.birminghampens.com/">Birmingham Pen Company</a> — <a href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2021/11/2/birmingham-pen-company-pennsylvania-slate-ink-review">Pennsylvania Slate</a>. I was really happy with that ink and surprised by the color. I've been enjoying it ever since. Later, I broke out the other ink I currently have Birmingham Pen Co.: <a href="https://www.birminghampens.com/products/pincushion-moss">Pincushion Moss</a>. This ink is quite different than the previous one for one main reason (aside from the color!) — Pincushion Moss uses their Everlasting ink formula, which means it is a pigmented ink that is highly water-resistant. </p><p>In my day to day usage of pens and ink, I never use archival or water-resistant inks on purpose. I really don't have any requirements for using these types of ink in my daily routines, but I still enjoy using them. These types of ink can tend toward the dull side of the color spectrum due to the necessary ingredients that make an ink resistant to washing away. There really aren't many examples of bright or poppy archival inks for this reason. This is why Pincushion Moss really caught my eye. It's an organic green color that really reminds of my soft moss that you find in the forest. It's not bright, but it definitely draws my eye. It's light enough in color to stand apart from the typical dark office colors, but not bright enough to cause any problems. Plus, it's not a typical blue, black, or red which means you can use it alongside those colors if you need some kind of color coding system. </p>

<p>There's a fair bit of shading that makes the ink even more interesting to look at once it's dried on the page. It varies between a dark medium green to a lighter thin green. In a lot of lighting situations, it also looks gray and brown. This just makes the moss connection even stronger for me because those are the same colors you'll find around moss in the wild when it's on the forest floor or up against some gray tree bark. The color isn't exciting in a pop-off-the-page way, but it's certainly an eye-catching and interesting color. </p><p>The archival quality of the ink is stellar. In my rudimentary tests, there's only a slight decrease in saturation after the paper sample is totally submerged in water for a bit. I couldn't get the ink to smudge either, proving that the chemical bond took place and the ink is now one with the paper. If archival ink is your thing, this one certainly does the trick. </p>

<p>The most astonishing think about this ink that I discovered is the dry time. This is seriously impressive. In most cases, the ink was dry in as little as five seconds. I couldn't do any tests that resulted in smears at the ten-second mark. This ink dries <em>incredibly fast</em>. I'm not a left-handed writer, but I'm pretty sure this dry time should catch the attention of the lefty crowd. I haven't been this surprised by a dry time for quite a while. Seriously impressive!</p><p>The only downside I've noticed with this ink is the tendency for it to feather a bit at the edges when it's drying. It's nothing major, but you can see it when you look closely. It feels like a fairly wet ink, and I assume this has something to do with the water content that allows the pigments to suspend properly until they come in contact with paper. It feels great while writing — not scratchy at all — but the feathering does show up here and there, unfortunately. </p>

<p>I love that Birmingham Pen Co. prints some guidance on the ink bottle packaging that explains how to use the Everlasting ink. Tips like, "don't allow the ink to dry inside the pen," and "do not use in demonstrator pens" may sound scary, but it's just part of the territory when using pigmented inks. I appreciate that they've printed some clear and concise tips for the uninitiated. Even with those warnings, you shouldn't be scared to try out this ink! Just make sure you use the pen regularly to avoid any drying/clogging issues, and wash it out when you're done! If your pen does get a little clogged, a thorough cleaning will restore it in no time. But you shouldn't use this ink in a clear pen as it might stain the plastic. </p><p>Overall, I've been really pleased by this organic-looking ink! The color is exactly what I'd want in an ink that has "moss" in the name, and the super fast dry time is such an unexpected treat. Throw the everlasting nature of the ink on top and you've got a winner. </p><p><a href="https://www.birminghampens.com/products/pincushion-moss">Pincushion Moss</a> is available in three size: 30ml, 60ml, and 120ml for $19, $29, and $39 respectively. This is a little more expensive than their normal inks, but the Everlasting formula comes at a (well-owed) premium. If you're looking for a lovely green, a quick drying ink, or an archival ink for your collection, add this one to your list! </p><p>(<em><a href="https://www.birminghampens.com/">Birmingham Pen Co.</a> provided this product at no charge to The Pen Addict for review purposes.</em>)</p><hr /><p><em>Enjoy reading The Pen Addict?

<p>The <a href="https://goldspot.com/collections/lamy-xevo">Lamy Xevo</a> is exactly what an entry level pen should be.</p><p>When I first saw pictures of the Xevo I was intrigued. Is this a metal barrel? Plastic? Twist mechanism, or knock? $50? $25? I really liked it, but the answer to those questions, plus its performance, would determine how much.</p><p>To answer a few of those original questions, this is a plastic barrel pen with a twist mechanism to deploy the refill. And the price? $10.</p>

<p>The Xevo is a Lamy design from top to bottom. If you are into stationery even just a little bit, you can pick a Lamy pen out of a lineup with relative ease. I think that is great. Even the outlier designs - like the Safari or Tipo - are pure Lamy. They have great cohesion throughout the brand.</p><p>And they have me spoiled, too. I’m as hard on Lamy as I am on any company, but that is because 1. Everything they do, they do well, and 2. I want more of it. The second part is my problem, and this beloved German brand certainly knows their job better than I do. A boy can dream, right?</p>

<p>I picked up the Light Grey from Goldspot recently, and what I found is a workhorse pen that is great for any writing situation. The plastic barrel is lightweight and comfortable, especially with the triangular grip that you are free to rotate in your hands to your heart’s content. The twist mechanism is solid, with a short, station-to-station engagement. A quick twist clockwise engages the refill, and a quick counter the opposite direction snaps it back.</p>

<p>It should come as no surprise that the clip is great, too. This is Lamy, after all.</p><p>Writing wise, the Xevo uses the standard M16 ballpoint found across many Lamy models. It’s a great ballpoint, but you are mostly stuck with it. There is no Parker-style, or Pilot G2 compatibility - only <a href="https://goldspot.com/products/lamy-refills-by-monteverde-blue-black-ballpoint-pen">Monteverde makes a matching refill</a>, with a few more ballpoint ink colors than Lamy offers.</p>

<p>The medium black lines from this refill are dark and smooth, and there was no spidering or ink blobbing to speak of. It’s one of the “good ones” as far as ballpoint refill types go.</p><p>And the Xevo is one of the good ones as well. It surprised me for many reasons, primarily the quality for the price. It is in the Tipo category, and for my money, that’s a good place to be.</p><p>Now, when orange barrel, Lamy???</p><p>(<em>I purchased this pen at <a href="https://goldspot.com/">Goldspot</a> using a 10% off coupon code.</em>)</p><hr /><p><em>Enjoy reading The Pen Addict?

      <description><![CDATA[<p>(<em>Kimberly (she/her) took the express train down the fountain pen/stationery rabbit hole and doesn't want to be rescued. She can be found on Instagram  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/allthehobbies/">@allthehobbies</a> because there really are many, many hobbies!.</em>)</p><p>(Don’t worry, there won’t be any spoilers until way further down, so if you haven’t busted out Day 1 of the Diamine Inkvent 2021 Calendar yet, you can read most of this article without seeing the swatches, though good luck avoiding the spoilers on Instagram!)</p><p>I wanted to give a quick overview of how I swatch my inks which will also be a part of my future ink reviews (so many things to review, so little time!). Everyone does this differently so do whatever works for you! I love seeing the variety that is out there but I also know how (1) not remotely artsy I am and (2) extremely lazy I am. </p><p>As mentioned in <a href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2021/11/25/so-much-to-be-grateful-for">the gratitude article</a>, one of the things I love and use A LOT are the Col-O-Ring Ink Testing Books from <a href="https://wellappointeddesk.bigcartel.com/product/col-o-ring-ink-testing-book">The Well-Appointed Desk</a>. The rings make it easy to sort, flip through, and they are very portable too. After swatching a couple dozen inks when I first got my samples, I quickly realized I wanted two sets so I could sort by brand and by color. For example, I may want to find out what color “Cult Pens Robert” is without flipping through the colors to guess what color it might be. Or I may also want to see what colors match my pen (we all know this is one of my favorite parts of this hobby). Having two sets makes it easy to do both.</p><p>A while back, one of my packages had a leaky bottle which leaked over an Endless Recorder notebook with 68 gsm Tomoe River paper. Shout out to Pen Chalet for replacing the notebook, but what was I going to do with a notebook that had an inky cover? Why not use it as an ink journal of sorts? So that’s what I set out to do. And while I was at it, why not also use some 52 gsm Tomoe River notebook inserts from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/curnowbooknleather/">Curnow Bookbinding</a> too? And as of a few days ago, why not add the Cosmo Air Light (CAL) 75 gsm notebook insert to the mix? Anyway, you can see how quickly this can escalate if you’re not careful, lol.</p><p>Here’s my setup for doing the swatches.</p>

<p>I like to use a glass dip pen but you can use a regular calligraphy dip nib or dip a fountain pen, but I find that the latter results in more cleaning because the ink gets into the feed, and you may dilute the next writing sample because there’s water in the feed from cleaning. I like the glass dip pens with caps that you can get on eBay, because I can put them in my accessories pouch without worrying about breaking the tip. You can also use fountain pen dip pen holders like the <a href="https://pensivepens.com.au/products/serendipity-hybrid-pen">Serendipity from Pensive Pens</a> (prices in AUD and there are several models) which has a friction-fit nib/feed or from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reddragonpenco/">Red Dragon Pen Co</a> which allows you to screw in a Jowo 6 nib unit.</p>

<p>I dip my glass dip pen into the ink and always drag it against the lip of the vial/bottle to remove excess ink. The resulting writing sample is pretty close to what I would get from a western medium nib, which is my sweet spot. If you prefer finer or broader lines, consider a dip nib with a finer point, or even an italic nib. Just know that they have to be thoroughly cleaned and dried when you’re done so they don’t rust, and even then, they have a shorter life span than glass dip nibs (unless you break the tip). </p><p>I write the brand/name of the ink as well as figure 8s and Xs which sort of simulates cursive and print. The brand swatch is a small rectangle and the color swatch takes up the lower half of the card. I use the “wrong” end of a paintbrush to swab the ink. I’ve also used plastic dip pen holders, chopsticks (only plastic ones) and I know folks who use straight letter openers, palette knives and basically any long, thin, non-porous implement that’s easy to clean. I don’t use cotton swabs because they soak up a lot of ink, they don’t release said ink as thoroughly, especially the shimmer particles and sheen, and I don’t like the waste. I also don’t use paintbrushes because I’m usually swatching multiple inks in a session and it takes a long time to clean the brushes and there is always some water left in the brush so I don’t want to dilute the next swatch. Again, what I use/don’t use is personal preference, so use whatever tools that work for you.</p>

<p>If I’m swatching samples, I also slap a circular label on the top and swab the vial cap too. And depending on the bottle, I may also put a label on the bottle cap if they aren’t easily identifiable from the top (Diamine and Birmingham bottles are the two that come to mind). Putting the tables on vials/bottles also makes it easy for me to tell if I’ve swatched them without checking on FPC.</p>

<p>Once the Col-O-Ring cards are done, it’s on to the notebooks. I use the ruling pen to do a wide line in the Endless Recorder and use the glass dip pen for the other two inserts. The notebooks are roughly sorted in ROYGBIV order but since I never seem to have enough pages between colors, so it’s a bit all over the place right now. I don’t try to group colors too closely, so there might be a light lavender ink just before a dark purple on the same page. Since I don’t really use these notebooks for quick reference, like I do with the Col-O-Rings, it’s less important to me that similar shades are next to each other. I’ve also done some other groupings like all Iroshizuku, since there aren’t that many colors, or the 2019 Diamine Inkvent colors.</p>

<p>If you’re doing more than a few inks, it’s handy to be able to clean your dip pen at your desk instead of getting up to clean them at the sink (I did mention that I’m lazy, right?). This is where the syringe and two cups come in handy. I use plastic cups because they clean easily, are light, don’t absorb the ink and so I don’t stain our drinking cups, lol. I put these cups and syringe (with the tip safely tucked into the barrel) into my accessories bag when I go to pen meetups and have time to swatch inks.</p>

<p>Before I jump into this year’s Diamine Inkvent calendar, if you missed out on the calendar (though it’s still available out there!) or just felt like you already have too many samples you haven’t swatched, consider making your own Inkvent calendar! I’ve repurposed (ok, stolen) my son’s opened LEGO advent calendars and put random, unswatched samples and voila, Inkvent calendar! You can also just put 25 samples in a baggie, close your eyes, and grab one - easy peasy!</p>

<p><strong>Spoiler Alert:</strong> Alright, Diamine Inkvent calendar time, swatches ahead!</p><p>Diamine released their first Inkvent calendar for 2019. The calendar included 24 - 7ml samples of inks and a 30 ml bottle for day 25, all housed behind closed doors in a beautifully decorated blue box. There were a wide variety of inks including saturated, shading, shimmer and sheening inks. They eventually released all 25 inks in adorable glass bottles, dubbed the Blue Edition (this was one of my <a href="https://vanness1938.com/products/diamine-blue-edition-winter-miracle-shimmer-sheen">favorite Inkvent 2019 ink</a>. Due to the pandemic, they did not release an Inkvent calendar for 2020, but they came back this year with the Red Edition for 2021. This year, the bottles are now plastic 12 ml square-ish bottles and the day 25 ink is still 30 ml. Retail price for the Inkvent Calendar is $110 in the US, though prices are often lower from the EU. </p>

<p>The ink goes down like a dark purple, much like the Esterbrook Lilac Shimmer that I just swatched but then it dries to a more muted color. On the Col-O-Ring, it almost looks brown, but there’s some purple tone to it. There is also some gold sheen in the swatch but it wasn’t really visible in the writing sample. On both the Tomoe River and CAL papers, it is a very dark purple and you don’t really see the brown nor the muted tone. You do get a bit of the sheen in the thick line of ink on 68 gsm (and I suspect you’d see a bit more sheen on 52 gsm if I did a similar swatch). The closest ink swatch card I have to this is Robert Oster Smokescreen, which is a brown ink that has a touch of purple. Hard to gauge flow from such a limited writing sample and swatching but it felt average for wetness/flow.</p>

<p>You can see more of the purple in the notebook papers but even then, this ink doesn’t scream purple to me. It seems fine but doesn’t wow me. But since I don’t have many other inks like this one, I’ll put it in a pen at some point down the road. That’s it for now. I’m still eager to see what the remaining 24 inks look like and look forward to seeing your Inkvent swatches, whether they’re from the Diamine calendar or your own swaps or stashes! Stay inky!</p>]]></description>

And since I’m writing it, I suppose I did, too. I did not win this year, but I didn’t think I would. What I did do is write about 30k words, which I certainly would not have done if I hadn’t given myself the extra productivity nudge that NaNoWriMo provides. I’m happy with that!</p><p>My book is still far from done, but progress is progress and momentum begets momentum, and despite the fact that I spent most of my spare time on that project this past month, I’m excited to keep moving forward with it and keep devoting time to this manuscript till it’s a full draft. Usually I’m sick of a project by the end of November, but I’m ready to NaNo my way through December as well. And probably January. This is going to be a long book.</p>

<p>The best part of NaNoWriMo this year was getting to see some writing friends in person again. I attended five group write-ins this month, and a huge chunk of my progress is a result of that revelry. Working quietly in a room with other writers, with chat breaks and snacks and prizes, is the perfect blend of friendship and accountability to keep the words flowing.</p>






















        <figure class="
              sqs-block-image-figure

        </figure>









<p>Another highlight, of course, is getting to use my pens and paper. I emptied eight pens and made good progress emptying another three that were all eyedropper pens (my Omas will never empty. I’m convinced). I rotated a new pen for each writing sprint or session, so they all got equal use. As I emptied them, I added them to my to-be-cleaned pile, which was already WAY out of hand. Now I have a mountain of pen cleaning to do. Maybe December should always be NaPeCleMo. I am now left with only five pens inked, which is a very low number, for me! I’m going to try and empty the rest before I ink any more…</p>

<p>The last highlight of the month for me was my now traditional holiday weekend writing escape. The hardest part of writing is finding the time, space, and silence to actually do it. I now make a point of claiming all three by running away to a quiet hotel by myself for a long weekend where I can devote all my time to writing for those days. It became necessary last year when I was home-schooling my kids through the pandemic and hadn’t had time to write for a number of important deadlines. This year hasn’t been any easier, turns out. My youngest was home in quarantine most of the month, so daylight hours were spent with him and night hours had to be for my own grad school homework, leaving no more hours for writing. More than a third of my writing for the month happened at the lake. </p>

<p>My NaNo kit worked well for me this year. The pens I used were all excellent. I thought for a long time about which one I enjoyed writing with the most this month, but it was impossible to choose. Each one was the best while I was using it. I did realize that my planning notebook for this project, the FIeld Notes Dime Novel Edition, will be a bit too small to contain all of the notes for this book, so I’ll have to add an additional volume. It’s not ideal, as it will mean carrying an extra notebook around, but it does mean I’ll get to use up another fun notebook from my stash.</p>

<p>And speaking of carrying around, my writing kit has now been effectively wrangled by a new bag, the Tom Bihn Parental Unit. I resisted this bag for a long time, as it’s marketed as a diaper bag and my kids are out of diapers, but when they announced that this recent update might be the last run of it for a while, I decided to cave. I’m so glad I did. This is the perfect writing bag. I won’t launch into a full review here, especially as I’m not sure if/when it will be available again, but it is now my favorite bag that I own, and I do not say that lightly. </p><p>I hope your NaNoWriMo was successful by any measure, even if not by words. Remember that you get to decide your own definition of success when it comes to art. Whether you participated or not, I hope you got to spend some quality time with your writing tools this month.</p><hr /><p><em>Enjoy reading The Pen Addict?

<p>If there's one thing that the stationery world <em>doesn't</em> lack, it's pocket fountain pens. There are a few go-to models, but not a ton of choice. That's why it's always exciting to try out new pocket-able fountain pens when they come out. They're a niche that not everyone is into, but for those of us that love a good fountain pen in a small size, it's just our thing. </p><p>I've had the opportunity to use the <a href="https://www.namisu.com/collections/n1-pocket-pen">Namisu N1</a> for a few months now, and I've been really happy with it. The Namisu N1 is a small pocket fountain pen made from machined metal. It's sleek, simple, and durable, and the small size is just the cherry on top. </p>

<p>Measuring just 104mm (4.1"), it's roughly the same size as a capped Kaweco Sport. The pen body by itself is just under 100mm (3.9"). But, when posted, it can vary between 123mm (4.8") and 146mm (5.75") thanks to the triple o-ring friction fit design that keeps the cap in place. Due to the perfect amount of friction, you can easily adjust the length of the full pen without worrying about it sliding while you're writing. I've really enjoyed being able to adjust the length of the pen so easily — you can quickly change the feel of this pen by just extending or reducing the length. </p>

<p>The o-rings slide against the aluminum easily enough, but they also have plenty of friction to keep the cap in place when capped or posted. I don't have any worries about the cap moving around unless I want it to. The tolerance is just right. This pen would be terrible if the friction was any different. </p><p>The model I have was a limited run made from aluminum. The two-tone contrast of the bright polished aluminum body and the anodized blue cap is awesome. The matte clip is sleek and strong, and the knurling along the top of the pen body and the grip section is fantastic. It has a great texture and feels great when writing with the pen or when pulling the pen body out of the cap for use. </p>

<p>The grip section unscrews from the rest of the body, and this is where you can replace the cartridges. I'm using an international short cartridge right now, but you could fit something up to 68mm long. Some cartridge converters will fit, but it really depends on the length as well as the diameter. You should probably surrender to using cartridges with this pen if you decide to pick one up. </p><p>Writing with the pen is such a great experience. The weight of the pen is just right, and the knurled grip provides fantastic grip and comfort. On top of that, you can adjust the overall length of the pen by sliding the cap up or down the body to find that perfect fit for your hand. </p>

<p>The pen is fitted with a Bock nib unit — EF in my case. The nib is okay, but I wish it flowed a little better. I could fix this pretty quickly, but it's worth pointing out that it was perfectly tuned out of the box. It writes fine, but the line feels a little dry compared to other EF nibs I use consistently. There isn't any Namisu branding on the nib — it's a standard Bock nib. </p>

<p>While you can't get the two-tone aluminum version any more, you can grab a new titanium version of this pen. It is surely lighter than this aluminum version, but I don't think will detract from the writing experience at all. In fact, I think I'd like the lighter weight even more than this one. </p><p><a href="https://www.namisu.com/collections/n1-pocket-pen">Normally £98.50</a>, this feels like a fair price for a custom machined pen that has been designed well and feels great in the hand and while writing. You can find them on sale or even nab some prototype units for a little cheaper (50% off) while they're available. Either way, this is a fantastic pen. If you like the aesthetic, try one out! </p><p>(<em>This pen was purchased from Namisu via Kickstarter.</em>)</p><hr /><p><em>Enjoy reading The Pen Addict?

<p>The <a href="https://yosekastationery.com/products/kokuyo-x-platinum-preppy-perpanep-0-3mm">Kokuyo X Platinum Preppy Perpanep Fountain Pen</a> could be the next highly sought after disposable pen. I’ll explain that thought in a moment, but first we have to get one thing out of the way: The name of this product line is atrocious.</p><p>From Kokuyo:</p><blockquote>
<p>“The brand name "PERPANEP" is a combination of the words "pen" and "paper".
This stationery series was designed with the best combination of pen and paper in mind.”</p>
</blockquote><p>They did this on purpose. They sat in a meeting, brainstormed, and decided this was a good idea. Kokuyo, one of the largest stationery brands in the world, with what has to be a sizable marketing budget, chose Perpanep. An anagram of “pen” and “paper.” Again, on purpose.</p><p>Le sigh.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kokuyo-Perpanep-Notebooks/ct/6280">Perpanep paper lineup</a> consists of three notebooks, each with their own paper type - Ultra Smooth, Smooth, and Textured. The Ultra Smooth and Textured papers are recommended for Fineliners and Fountain Pens, while the Smooth is recommended for Gel Pens, Ballpoint Pens, and Pencils. I hope to have a review here soon of all three notebooks, but in the meantime, check out Ana’a breakdown at <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2021/09/paper-review-kokuyo-perpanep-a5-notebooks/">The Well-Appointed Desk</a>.</p><p>At launch, there were no pens or pencils designed to bring you the “best combination of pen and paper.” There were only notebooks. Certainly, if Kokuyo made pens and pencils to match, I would have jumped on those, but at least they collaborated with Platinum for a branded Preppy model.</p>

<p>This pen was an insta-buy the moment I saw it while browsing Yoseka Stationery. Why such an immediate positive reaction to what is ostensibly an overpriced Preppy? For that, I need to share with you the story of the <a href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2009/7/16/review-sailor-ink-bar-disposable-fountain-pen-fine-nib-blue.html">Sailor Ink Bar</a>.</p><p>When I posted my Ink Bar review in July, 2009, I had just received it from a friend in Japan. The pen eventually made its way to <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sailor-Ink-Bar-Disposable-Fountain-Pen-Fine-Nib-Blue-Black/pd/4546">JetPens</a>, and I acquired a few more. Then they vanished - no longer available for purchase anywhere.</p><p>As a nascent fountain pen user, I loved the Ink Bar. It was simple, self-contained (unrefillable,) had a great nib, wrote well, and cost $3. As it turns out, I wasn’t the only one who liked it. Once they became hard to find, the amount of emails I received about the Ink Bar increased. People LOVED this pen, and Sailor did away with it, never to return.</p>

<p>The Perpanep, visually speaking, brought me right back to the Ink Bar, making it an instant purchase.</p><p>This pen is 100% Platinum Preppy outside of the logo on the barrel. That means, it is already one of the best inexpensive pens you can buy. The 03 Fine nib is round, smooth, and writes wonderfully. It’s refillable, using Platinum proprietary cartridges, and the cap contains their patented Slip and Seal mechanism to keep the nib from drying out.</p>

<p>The only true difference between the Kokuyo branded model and a traditional Platinum Preppy is price. You will pay $3 more ($7.50 vs. $4.50) for the artwork, and the beauty of the word “PERPANEP” stamped on the side of the barrel.</p><p>For me, it was worth it. The basic white plastic aesthetic is something I love, and combined with an already great product in the Preppy there was no doubt it was heading to my house. The only problem now is I am forced to figure out other stationery anagrams to get ahead of Kokuyo’s next branding adventure.</p><p>(<em>I purchased this pen from <a href="https://yosekastationery.com/">Yoseka Stationery</a> at full retail price.</em>)</p><hr /><p><em>Enjoy reading The Pen Addict?

<p>My thanks to <a href="https://www.spacepen.com/">Fisher Space Pen Co.</a> for sponsoring The Pen Addict this week.</p>
<p>Just in time for the holidays, Fisher Space Pen Co., releases new colors of their <a href="https://www.spacepen.com/backpacker.aspx">Backpacker Space Pen</a>, the perfect gift for travelers. The new Backpackers come in Forest Green, Purple and Gun Metal Gray. Like all Fisher Space Pens, the new Backpackers write upside down, under water, in extreme temperatures from -30 to +250 degrees F (-35 to +121 Celsius), over almost any surface, and three times longer than the average pen. And, they won’t explode or spill ink in the pressurized cabin of an airliner. The Backpacker is a two-piece space pen with a key ring on its cap that easily attaches to your keys, backpack, hiking gear, belt loop or suitcase. It can hang upside down for months and will function immediately when needed. All Fisher Space Pen products are guaranteed for life. Whether you’re on a warm beach or on a frigid mountain, Fisher Space Pens will keep writing under all weather conditions.</p>]]></description>

      <title>So Much to be Grateful For</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>(<em>Kimberly (she/her) took the express train down the fountain pen/stationery rabbit hole and doesn't want to be rescued. She can be found on Instagram  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/allthehobbies/">@allthehobbies</a> because there really are many, many hobbies!.</em>)</p><p>Knowing that this post is going up on Black Friday meant that I could devote an entire article to a bunch of places that are vying for your post-turkey dollars. Instead, I decided to reflect on and share some of the little (and not so little) things that I’m grateful for this season, and really all year long. These aren’t in any particular order because it’s kind of impossible to rank them so here goes:</p><p><strong>Pen Stores</strong> - Whether brick and mortar or online only, there are so many wonderful pen stores all around the world that we can shop from. It used to be much harder to buy from other countries and even with the pandemic, many shops still ship worldwide, making it easier than ever to get things that may not be offered in your country.  </p><p><strong>Ink Miser</strong> - Do you know how hard it is to get the last little bit of an ink sample from a vial? Especially when the ink level is below where the nib can get any ink and where the converter is likely to get dropped into the vial? I love that this little <a href="https://vanness1938.com/products/ink-miser-ink-shot-inkwell">Ink Miser</a> makes it easier for me to get the most out of ink samples. And even if there’s plenty of ink in the vial, I put the vial in the Ink Miser, which in turns goes into a holder made from my son’s LEGO pieces (sssh, don’t tell him) and it prevents me from knocking it over even though it’s pretty stable on its own.  </p>

<p><strong>Fountain Pen Companion</strong> - I already waxed poetic (or not so poetic) about how much <a href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2021/9/24/fountain-pen-companion-not-just-for-ink-addicts">I love FPC</a> but it really deserves another mention because I use it pretty much every day and often, multiple times a day. Tracking my pen/ink usage as well as my inventory gives this inkophile and pen addict a little more sanity.</p><p><strong>Col-O-Ring ink swatch cards</strong> - You know what else saves my sanity? Having swatch cards for my inks. II started swatching my inks on these <a href="https://wellappointeddesk.bigcartel.com/product/col-o-ring-ink-testing-book">Col-O-Ring Ink Testing Cards</a> shortly after getting my first ink samples 4+ years ago and umpteen rings later, I’m still not done. They’ve held up great (though I did upgrade all my rings to 2” ones so I can put 200 cards per ring) and are super useful at pen meetups and pen shows, and yes, also at my desk, while I figure out what the perfect matchy match ink is going to be. </p>

<p><strong>Instagram</strong> - I know it can be a time sink and who can figure out their algorithm, but I love scrolling through my IG feed, seeing people’s pens/inks/stationery and how they use them. Sometimes I get inspired by posts to do something similar, other times, I just marvel at people’s creativity, humor, handwriting, photography, or collections. The IG pen community has also been very encouraging, helpful and supportive regardless of what pens you write with or how much they cost. I am so grateful to have pen friends scattered all over the world that I hope to meet some day.</p>
<p><strong>Scientists/Medical Professionals/Vaccines/Boosters</strong> - Without them, things would be so much worse and it would be longer before I got to see pen friends again. Because of all their efforts, meetups and pen shows are happening again. If you haven’t yet gotten vaccinated/boosted, please do so we can all get this pandemic behind us. And if you have, thank you! ❤️</p>
<p><strong>Pen Shows</strong> - I was so lucky to find out that the SF Pen Show was happening just a couple months after I got my first fountain pen. Little did I know that I would get the opportunity to go to more shows after that and even get to work behind the table too. But it’s the pen shows after dark, where folks are gathered around playing with pens, hanging out with pen friends and just enjoying each other’s company, that really make me love pen shows. And being able to go to 3 shows this year after the last 18+ months and seeing my pen friends was really special and truly lifted my spirits.</p>
<p><strong>Zoom</strong> - Ok, I know what you’re thinking. Zoom (and others) are the worst and we’re all tired of Zoom meetings. But, they’ve really been a saving grace during this pandemic. I was able to join and meet folks from pen groups in DC, Indiana, Missouri, Colorado, Southern California and yes, even my own local pen posse. Being able to connect with pen people and see their faces and hear their voices was something I really needed. So, while I’d much rather see people in person, I’m so glad this technology exists to keep us connected.</p>
<p><strong>Pilot Metropolitan/Lamy Safari/Platinum Preppy</strong> - I will forever be grateful that these were my first fountain pens (yes, they all arrived on the same day) because they were all wonderful pens that I enjoyed from day one and still often have at least one inked up. If I didn’t have such good experiences with them, I might not have fallen down the rabbit hole and only my wallet would be happier for that.</p>

<p><strong>Ink Samples</strong> - I am so glad ink samples are a thing because while I do have a stupid number of bottles, it would be even stupider if ink samples didn’t exist and I had to buy full bottles. I love having samples to try new inks and also making samples for friends too. </p><p><strong>Rock Your Handwriting</strong> - I had discovered fountain pens after joining a Facebook group called Rock Your Handwriting, where people posted pictures of their handwritten responses to daily prompts. I saw these pretty pens and inks and promptly spent the next two nights reading everything I could and starting my first (of many) order for fountain pens. I probably spent the next two years following the RYH prompts and posting them on Instagram and Facebook. If it wasn’t for RYH, I don’t know if I would have ever discovered FPs and by extension, everything else on this list.</p>

<p><strong>Bullet Journaling</strong> - Wait a second, what does this have to with pens? Prior to 2017, I had been on a quest to find a planner that had a layout I liked and stumbled upon bullet journaling, which led to a random post about improving your handwriting and as you just read, the rest is history. And yes, I still bullet journal on a regular basis and am extremely unproductive whenever I’ve fallen off the wagon.</p><p><strong>Good paper</strong> - I am so thankful that there is a plethora of good stationery that is fountain pen-friendly! From Tomoe River to Midori, to Cosmo Air Light, Black n Red/Optik paper, Clairefontaine, Ayush Paper and more, there’s just so much variety out there that one can take advantage of.</p>

<p><strong>Pen Friends</strong> - I’ve mentioned them several times throughout this post but this hobby wouldn’t be the same without pen friends. Whether real-life friends or online friends from another state or halfway around the world, I couldn’t imagine feeling the same sense of community without them. Thank you for sharing my excitement of pens/inks/all things stationery, being helpful and supportive, sharing of your knowledge and of yourself in your posts and being a part of this community. </p>
<p><strong>Brad</strong> - Without him, I wouldn’t be writing for the Pen Addict, nor would I have ever discovered the Pen Addict Slack and by extension, many of the pen friends I call family. Ok, this one might be one of the bigger things that I’m grateful for. ;-)</p>

<p>I am a Lamy Safari superfan. I don’t have a collection of ALL THE COLORS, nor do I buy every new one when it drops. But when a release checks all of my boxes, like the <a href="https://goldspot.com/products/lamy-safari-fountain-pen-in-shiny-white-with-red-clip">Lamy Safari Shiny White and Red</a> does, I’m in on day one. I picked one up for giveaway, too, with a Fine steel nib. Read the rules below and enter away!</p>

<p>Just in time for the holidays, <a href="https://www.spacepen.com/">Fisher Space Pen Co.</a>, releases new colors of their Backpacker Space Pen, the perfect gift for travelers. The new Backpackers come in Forest Green, Purple and Gun Metal Gray. Like all Fisher Space Pens, the new Backpackers write upside down, under water, in extreme temperatures from -30 to +250 degrees F (-35 to +121 Celsius), over almost any surface, and three times longer than the average pen. And, they won’t explode or spill ink in the pressurized cabin of an airliner. The Backpacker is a two-piece space pen with a key ring on its cap that easily attaches to your keys, backpack, hiking gear, belt loop or suitcase. It can hang upside down for months and will function immediately when needed. All Fisher Space Pen products are guaranteed for life. Whether you’re on a warm beach or on a frigid mountain, Fisher Space Pens will keep writing under all weather conditions. <a href="https://www.spacepen.com/backpacker.aspx">View and Shop Fisher Backpacker Space Pens</a></p>
